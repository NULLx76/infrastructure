# Common Desktop Config
This is where I store the NixOS config that is common between
my laptop and desktop

## Files
* `./default.nix`: Contains common systemwide configuration
  * See also my NixOS [modules](../modules), specifically gnome
* `./home.nix`: Contains common user-level configuration
  * See also my Home-Manager [modules](../hm-modules)
